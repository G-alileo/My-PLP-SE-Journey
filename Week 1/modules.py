# Python comes with a toolkit of modulesâ€”specialized code libraries that you can use without building everything from scratch. Itâ€™s like using a toolbox instead of crafting tools by hand! ðŸ”¨
# To use a module, just import it:
import random

# Generate a random number between 1 and 6 (like rolling a die)
dice_roll = random.randint(1, 6)
print("You rolled a", dice_roll)
